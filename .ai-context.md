# Current State of Voice Agents

## What's Built ✅
1. **All 4 agent frameworks** with factory functions and proper tool definitions
2. **Time-awareness utility** for Pacific Coast timezone
3. **PhreesiaComputer class** ready for Computer Use integration  
4. **AgentRegistry** managing all 4 agents with factory pattern
5. **Comprehensive system prompts** for each agent

## What Needs Integration 🚧
1. **Database callbacks** - Wire tool executions to actual PostgreSQL operations
2. **Computer Use** - Integrate PhreesiaComputer with DRS agent's navigate_phreesia tool
3. **Excel parser** - Add xlsx parsing for appointment confirmation campaigns
4. **Twilio routing** - Update voice server to route calls to appropriate agent
5. **External ticketing API** - Connect answering service to ticketing system

## Architecture Pattern ✅
- Factory functions create agents with proper callback wiring
- Registry stores factories, not singletons
- Each session gets fresh agent instance with tools wired to real systems
- Time context injected via dynamic instructions function
