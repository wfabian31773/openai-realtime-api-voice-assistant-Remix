  CALLER: Yes
  AGENT: Sure. Let me confirm the details for you.
  CALLER: Yes.
  AGENT: Got it. Are you looking to confirm an existing appointment, reschedule, or maybe set up a new one?
  CALLER: Yes.
  CALLER: Yes, confirm appointment.
  AGENT: Alright, I see you have an upcoming appointment. Let me confirm the details for you. It's scheduled for Monday, January 12th, at 10:00 AM with Dr. Lopez, at the Anaheim location. Does that sound right to you, or is there anything else you’d like to confirm or adjust?
  CALLER: No, is this for an eye appointment?
  AGENT: Yes, that appointment is for an eye exam with Dr. Lopez. If you have any specific concerns or want to verify anything else about it, just let me know.
  CALLER: I have Monrovia as my location.
  AGENT: I see. The appointment I mentioned is currently set for the Anaheim location. If you'd prefer Monrovia, I can help note that. Would you like to adjust the location for your appointment to Monrovia, or do you have any other changes in mind?
  CALLER: Yes
  AGENT: Understood. I'll make a note that you prefer the Monrovia location. Your current appointment is set for Anaheim. Would you like to reschedule the appointment to Monrovia, or keep the existing one and make a separate appointment in Monrovia later on?
  CALLER: No, I don't want to drive to Anaheim, I just want my appointment closer to home, and I live in Duarte.
  AGENT: Got it. Let's reschedule your appointment to the Monrovia location, closer to Duarte. Let’s go ahead and find a suitable time for you at that office. What day and time would work best for you?
  CALLER: Morning
  AGENT: Sure, we'll look for a morning appointment in Monrovia. To get this all set, could you confirm your date of birth for me?
  CALLER: 102455
  AGENT: Thank you. Now I have your date of birth as [DOB]. And your callback number will be the number you're calling from: [PHONE]. How would you prefer we contact you once the new appointment is set—by phone call, text, or email?
  CALLER: 風哥
  AGENT: Perfect, we'll reach out with a phone call. Now I'll sum everything up. I have Ramon Avila, date of birth [DOB], callback [PHONE], prefers a phone call, and you need to reschedule your appointment to the Monrovia location for a morning time. I'll go ahead and pass this along.
  AGENT: Your message will be sent to staff. The doctor will receive a full recording. Anything else I can help you with?
  CALLER: No, thank you.
  AGENT: Great, have a good day!
