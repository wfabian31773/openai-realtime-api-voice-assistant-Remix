# READ THIS BEFORE YOU DO ANYTHING

You are working with **Wayne** on the Azul Vision voice agents. Southern
California eye-care practice. Real patients call these numbers.

This file exists because of a specific, repeated failure: **losing the context
of what was already decided and already built, and then re-proposing it.**
Two examples from 2026-08-10 alone —

- I told Wayne to take the PCP line offline (my own plan, step 1). An hour
  later I asked him why PCP was offline.
- I built `src/core/replayRealCalls.test.ts` at 21:45. At 01:00 I proposed
  building a replay harness, as if it did not exist.

That is the thing that is driving him crazy. It is not a code problem.
**Read this file and `docs/observatory/STATE-OF-PLAY.md` at the start of every
session, and re-read before proposing any plan.** If you are about to say "I
don't know why X" or "we should build Y" — check here first. It is probably
written down.

## Before touching the ticket path, read `docs/BACKEND_HANDOFF.md`

Written 2026-08-20 after a week that made surgery routing WORSE — provider fill
on department 2 went from ~98% to 49% across three merged PRs that all passed
their tests. That document holds the traced architecture, the real API contract
(which is wider than our TypeScript interfaces — three things were requested
from another team that already existed), the measured state of each queue, the
operator's standing rulings, and a list of changes that were tried and made
things worse.

The single rule it exists to enforce: **do not merge a change to the ticket path
without measuring the production number it is meant to move, before and after.**
Green tests did not prevent any of the regressions listed there.

## Wayne's standing instructions — these do not expire

1. **"If you don't know something, don't fill in the gaps. Ask me. And if I
   don't know, then I'll take your recommendation. But other than that, if
   it's procedural stuff, you need to ask me."**
   Procedural/domain questions go to him. Do not invent business rules.

2. **"Same exact agent, different voice pipeline. Nothing in the agent changes
   but the voice pipeline."**
   The ask has always been to swap the *pipeline* under the existing
   answering-service agent. It is NOT to write a new agent. I did that anyway
   and burned days on it. Do not do it again.

3. **"Why are you trying to determine what a first name is? You'll never ever
   get it to work like that."**
   Extraction is the LLM's job, not a regex's. This was proven correct: the
   model pulls `first_name: "Wayne", last_name: "Fabian",
   date_of_birth: "03/17/1973"` out of ordinary speech with no parser.

4. **"I don't want you to use Vapi, I want to create my own without using
   their platform."**

5. **"On the side without touching the real agents."**
   `answeringServiceAgent.ts` and the other production agents are off-limits
   unless he says otherwise. Pipeline changes go in `src/standalone/`.

6. **Verify against the mirror.** Patients verify against `patients_master`
   (the Eye Care Patient Console), not the appointment book. Carry the match
   forward as context and associate it on the ticket for staff.

7. **Capability boundary.** The answering service cannot transfer calls or
   schedule appointments. It must say so plainly and file a ticket.

8. **Stop making him the test harness.** A failing call goes into
   `replayRealCalls.test.ts` *before* any code changes. Show red-then-green
   offline. Do not ask him to dial to find out whether a guess was right.

9. **"There is no handoff for any of the answering service agents, only for
   PCP, Scheduling SD. All other agents politely state they are unable to
   handoff and can only create a request for a callback."** (2026-08-12)
   Those agents get **no transfer tool at all** — not a disabled one. A tool the
   agent cannot see is a promise it cannot make.

10. **Nobody is told to call back.** (2026-08-13) *"We can't just tell the
    patient call back, call the wrong extension."* Queues are forwarded; a
    caller who pressed the wrong option gets their request taken and routed.
    Schedule-related goes to the **HVA Hub from every queue — except a surgery
    date**: *"surgery is an exception to that hva hub rule."*

11. **Route by queue.** Each queue gets its own number, webhook and slug. Do not
    multiplex queues onto one agent behind a mode flag.

12. **Confirm the callback number BEFORE filing, not after.** Correcting it
    afterwards means a second ticket and a patient who was told the wrong thing.

13. **After hours, everything goes to the after-hours agent** via Nextiva
    enterprise routing, and it escalates to Wayne directly. *"It's impossible to
    reach that line after hours."* Do not build after-hours behaviour into a
    queue agent. **All overnight volume is on the no-IVR agent**, which Wayne
    uses as the after-hours agent (2026-08-13).

## Line status — check this before saying anything about what is on or off

As of **2026-08-11 01:00 UTC**. Update this table whenever it changes.

| Line | State | Who decided | Why |
|---|---|---|---|
| **answering-service** | **LIVE**, old core (`/api/voice/answering-service`) | — | 579 calls on Aug 10, its biggest day. Not broken. |
| **no-ivr** | **LIVE** | — | ~30–50/day. Produces the best transcripts; Wayne's quality benchmark. |
| **pcp** | **OFF** in Twilio | Wayne decided, **I recommended it and sequenced it as step 1** | Transfer failures seen Friday; complaints from surgery centers; medical-facing. *"I just cannot see the disasters I was seeing on Friday on that line."* Was ~200 calls/day. |
| **azul-scheduling** (San Diego) | **OFF** | Wayne, Aug 10–11 | Gate B replay: **books 8 of 21** the old core booked. Not ready. Was ~80 calls/day. |
| **claude-as** | Test number only | — | The Claude pipeline. **Unproven — zero clean end-to-end calls.** |
| **optical** (queue) | **LIVE** | Wayne, Aug 12 | Forwarded optical overflow. *"Optical works like a charm."* Dept 1, 1,744 tickets/90d. |
| **surgery** (queue) | **LIVE** | Wayne, Aug 12 | Dept 2. Filing was dead until the strict-mode schema fix; **VA-51121** is the proof it works. |
| **tech** (queue) | Built, number pending | Wayne, Aug 13 | Clinical Tech Support, dept 3 — **9,288 tickets/90d, 103/day, the largest queue in the practice.** It is the medication queue. |

**Queue lines take no calls after hours** — Nextiva routes everything to the
after-hours agent. See standing instruction 13.

**Do not ask Wayne why PCP or San Diego are off. It is written above.**

Production quality has been **flat all week** (avg quality 2.82 → 2.80 → 2.73).
Nothing built over the weekend has reached a line that takes calls.

## What already exists — do NOT rebuild these

| Thing | Where | What it does |
|---|---|---|
| Offline replay harness | `src/core/replayRealCalls.test.ts` | Replays real caller utterances from `call_logs` through the parser floor. 2 seconds, no phone. |
| Claude brain | `src/standalone/claudeBrain.ts` | The real agent's prompt + tools on a Claude tool loop. Borrows `agent.instructions` / `agent.tools`; reimplements nothing. |
| Latency/tool probes | `src/standalone/claudeProbe.ts` | `/demo/claude-probe` (TTFT), `/demo/tool-check` (tool selection). |
| Standalone line | `src/standalone/demoLine.ts` | Twilio Media Streams + Deepgram + brain + OpenAI-as-mouth. |
| Mirror verification | `src/services/patientVerification.ts` | Verifies against `patients_master`; refuses to guess between two people. |
| Appointment answers | `src/services/appointmentAnswers.ts` | `Schedule.PersonID` join; excludes `Removed`. |
| Replay tables | Operations Hub | `new_core_replay_summary`, `new_core_replay_index`, `ticket_agent_config` |

## Architecture facts that cost hours to learn

- **The old core's ear, brain and mouth are ONE OpenAI SIP session.**
  Twilio → conference → SIP → `sip.api.openai.com`. Audio never touches our
  servers. This is why STT cannot be swapped without changing the transport —
  that fact is the whole reason the standalone line exists.
- **Caller-ID pre-context is why the old core "knows who is calling."** It
  looks the number up *before answering*, so the agent says "Am I speaking
  with…?" — confirm, not ask. Wayne's number resolves to **eight** records in
  the mirror, so a phone match is a **candidate to confirm, never an identity**.
- Twilio `<Connect><Stream>` **replaces** the call (socket close = hangup);
  `<Start><Stream>` forks audio and the call continues.
- Twilio `mark` events are the **only** ground truth that audio actually played
  to a caller. `clear` discards Twilio's buffered audio.
- Deepgram: `is_final` (settled words) ≠ `speech_final` (caller stopped) ≠
  `UtteranceEnd`. Accumulate until `speech_final`/`UtteranceEnd` or every
  question gets asked twice.
- Anthropic: **every `tool_use` must be answered by a `tool_result` in the very
  next message.** If not, the API rejects the *whole history*, so one malformed
  turn kills every later turn of the call.
- Supabase projects:
  - **Operations Hub** `pslzngjciiifowemrzza` — `call_logs`, `Schedule`, `ticket_agent_config`
  - **Patient-Console** `kbbmywvasbsxnbblrhot` — `patients_master` (909,376 persons)
  - `Schedule.PersonID` (uuid) ↔ `patients_master.person_id`; `uuid = text`
    needs an explicit `::uuid` cast.

## Measured numbers — use these, don't re-derive them

- **Gate B replay** (same corpus, same referee), failure rates:
  answering service 57.5% → 34.6% → **19.1%**; PCP 61.1% → **28.6%**;
  after-hours 36.3% → **25.1%**; **SD not ready (books 8 of 21).**
- Question repetition across lines: 433 calls → 41 → **0** (ticket agent).
- **Haiku TTFT ~791ms** (viable for voice). **Sonnet 1,730ms** (too slow).
- Prompt caching: 10,576 → 94 input tokens, but only ~800ms saved — latency is
  **generation-bound, not prompt-bound.**

## How to tell whether a deploy actually took

Wayne pulls and republishes on Replit. **A failed pull looks exactly like a
failed fix.** On 2026-08-11 a GitHub rate limit at 00:34 UTC made his pull fail;
he called at 00:36 and I spent the next round analyzing stale code.

Before drawing any conclusion from a call, look for a log line that only exists
in the new build. Current marker:

```
[ScheduleLookup] 20 row(s) as of 2026-08-10 -> 3 past visit(s), 0 upcoming;
  last visit 2026-07-13; 17 not counted (cancelled, no-show, or cancelled-future)
```

**If the marker is absent, the code is not live and the call proves nothing.**
Whenever you ship something whose effect is hard to see, add a marker like this.

## My recurring failure modes — check yourself against this list

1. **Building instead of swapping.** He asked for a pipeline swap; I built a
   whole new agent (a state machine). Days lost.
2. **Patching symptoms.** Fix on top of fix on top of fix. He named this
   repeatedly and was right every time.
3. **Making him the test harness.** Changing code and asking him to dial to
   find out if it worked.
4. **Filling gaps instead of asking.** Inventing procedure he never approved.
5. **Losing context and re-asking / re-proposing** what was already decided or
   already built. This file is the fix. Use it.
6. **Declaring success before evidence.** Report what the log actually shows,
   including when it shows nothing.
7. **Theorising instead of diffing.** On 2026-08-12 I stated three wrong root
   causes out loud for one bug. What found it was a *control* — Wayne asking why
   Optical could file a ticket when Surgery could not. Two paths through the same
   code, one working: diff them before theorising. See
   `.agents/memory/realtime-tool-schemas.md`.
8. **Accepting a constraint as immovable.** I treated "the API has no way to
   express *no category*" as the end of the discussion. Wayne: *"why don't you
   just create one?"* Ask whether the constraint can be changed before designing
   around it.
